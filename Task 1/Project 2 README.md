**Project 2 – Pandas CSV Reader & Basic Analysis**

**Overview:**

This project demonstrates basic data analysis using pandas. The goal is to read a CSV file, inspect the data, perform basic statistical computations, filter rows, select columns, and save the results.

Dataset used: Titanic dataset (CSV link
)

**Features:** 

• Read CSV into a pandas DataFrame

• Inspect data: head, tail, dtypes, column names

• Compute summary statistics: mean, median, min, max, count

• Filter rows (e.g., all females, passengers above 50 years)

• Select specific columns and slice subsets

• Save filtered results to CSV and Excel

**Key Learnings:**

• Understanding pandas DataFrame operations

• Filtering and selecting data efficiently

• Combining multiple conditions for precise filtering

• Saving cleaned/filtered data for future use

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates basic data analysis with pandas, including inspection, filtering, column selection, and saving results. It forms the foundation for more advanced data manipulation and cleaning tasks.
